# LispHTMLGenerator (CLHTML)
A simple .html page/site generator written in Common Lisp 

## Installation

Download/clone this repo to your computer and run this in any Common Lisp REPL, though I have tested this in CLisp

## Usage

See "intro.md" for detailed information

To run this program, you need a Common Lisp REPL: I used CLisp to test this project, which can be found [here](http://www.gnu.org/software/clisp/)

In the REPL, type 
  
    $ (load "clhtml.lisp")
  
Assuming that clhtml.lisp is in your Home directory


If your clhtml.lisp is NOT in your Home directory, type

    $ (load "/path/clhtml.lisp")

"/path/" being where/what folder clhtml.lisp is stored in
